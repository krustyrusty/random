atomic types, i.e. types whose members have no internal structure, is the category of literals. Literals are divided into atoms and names. An Atom is symbolic entity that has an identity made up of a sequence of alphanumeric characters starting with a lower case letter, or arbitrary printable characters enclosed in quotes. For example:

a   foo   '='   ':='   'OZ 3.0'   'Hello World'
Atoms have an ordering based on lexicographic ordering.
