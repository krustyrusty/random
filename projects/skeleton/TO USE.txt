Make a copy of your skeleton directory. Name it after your new project.
Rename (move) the lib/NAME.rb file and lib/NAME/ directory to be the name of your project or whatever you want to call your root module.
Edit your Gemspec to have all the information for your project.
Rename tests/test_NAME.rb to also have your module name.
Double check it's all working by using ruby tests/test_yourproject.rb again.
Start coding.
